# CI TODO list

## Linux

linux can't send packets
at least when you make StartCapture on the same adapter nothing is received
possibly related to https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/issues/400

tests for linux have to run using `--filter TestCategory!=SendPacket`

## Npcap & rpcapd

rpcapd is broken in Npcap
See https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/1329

tests for Npcap have to run using `--filter TestCategory!=RemotePcap`

## Npcap OEM installer

latest version of Npcap available as silent installer is 0.86
see https://github.com/nmap/nmap/issues/900
scapy is using an OEM installer, possible to get one from https://nmap.org/npcap/oem/internal.html
sample config https://github.com/secdev/scapy/blob/master/.appveyor.yml#L6
